### Hi there 👋

Im a solo developper from Canada. I learned by myself and Im pretty damn good with javascript, python and c++. <br>
Im tryng to get better with React and Rust One day 😁😁. I love making 3rd party tools and extension. They're just great 😎😎.

- You might know me (I doubt it) from an extension I made for vscode -> [CPP_ extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bleastProgram.CPP-Compiler).       <br>
    It was basically and extension to automatically run C/CPP projects. Im quite proud of all the features it offers.<br>
    You can check it out if you want 😉😉
